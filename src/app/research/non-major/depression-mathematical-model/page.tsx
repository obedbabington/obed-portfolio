              As part of an independent research project, I developed a novel mathematical model of depression using differential equations to explore how populations transition between depression, remission, and recovery.

              This interdisciplinary project combined mathematical modeling with mental health research to better understand the dynamics of depression at a population level.

              The model used differential equations to represent the transitions between different states of mental health: depression, remission, and recovery. This approach allowed for the analysis of population-level dynamics and the identification of key factors that influence these transitions.

              By modeling these transitions mathematically, the project aimed to provide insights into the complex dynamics of mental health at a population level, potentially informing public health strategies and interventions.
