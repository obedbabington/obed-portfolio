            <Text variant="body-default-m">
              As a Research Intern at Ashesi University's CaRINE Programme, I explored how wearable technology can transform the practice of journaling into a seamless, productivity-enhancing experience. The project, called NOTE-IT, stemmed from a research gap: while journaling is proven to improve critical thinking and reduce information overload, cultivating the habit is difficult, and existing knowledge management tools often fail to capture the spontaneity of thought.

            <Text variant="body-default-m">
              Through a literature review, I examined how information overload impairs productivity and how journaling mitigates cognitive strain. I then conducted a needs survey with faculty and students, uncovering strong interest in a wearable solution despite concerns around privacy and usability.

              The result was NOTE-IT, a concept for a wearable device that enables instant, voice-based journaling. Thoughts are captured verbally, stored securely, and later organized through a companion mobile app.

              Reflecting back, this project positioned me to think critically about how emerging technologies can bridge human limitations in cognition and productivity. It demonstrated the importance of user-centered design in technology development and provided valuable experience in research methodology and concept development.
