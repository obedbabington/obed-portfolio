              This project involved applying mathematical modeling techniques to analyze the traffic flow patterns in Ashesi University's canteen. Using linear algebra principles, I developed a model to understand how students move through the canteen space and identify potential bottlenecks or optimization opportunities.

              The project used linear algebra techniques to represent the canteen as a network of nodes and edges, where each node represents a specific area (entrance, food stations, seating areas, exit) and edges represent the flow paths between these areas. This mathematical representation allowed for systematic analysis of traffic patterns.

              By modeling these transitions mathematically, the project aimed to provide insights into the complex dynamics of traffic flow and identify opportunities for improving efficiency and reducing congestion.

              The analysis provided valuable insights into how the canteen layout and flow patterns could be optimized to improve the student experience. This project demonstrated the practical application of mathematical modeling in real-world scenarios and provided a foundation for understanding how mathematical tools can be used to solve everyday problems.
