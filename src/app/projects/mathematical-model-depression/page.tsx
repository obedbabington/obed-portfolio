              Unlike many existing models focused on biological markers, my approach considered depression at the population and experiential level, factoring in remission, relapse, treatment effects, and even the influence of individuals in remission on the wider community.

              This comprehensive approach provided a more holistic understanding of depression dynamics by incorporating social and community factors alongside individual experiences.

              This work was both personal and academic: rooted in my interest in mental health and my conviction that mathematical models can illuminate human experiences often left to qualitative study. The model not only produced meaningful insights but also gave me the opportunity to merge applied mathematics with human-centered research, a theme I hope will shape my broader research journey.

              The model used differential equations to represent the transitions between different states of mental health: depression, remission, and recovery. This approach allowed for the analysis of population-level dynamics and the identification of key factors that influence these transitions.

            <Text variant="body-default-m">
              By modeling these transitions mathematically, the project aimed to provide insights into the complex dynamics of mental health at a population level, potentially informing public health strategies and interventions.
